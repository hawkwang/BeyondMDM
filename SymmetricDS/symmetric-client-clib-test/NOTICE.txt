==  SQLite                                                             ==

This product links to software developed by the SQLite project
(https://www.sqlite.org/) at Hwaci (http://www.hwaci.com/)
with copyright donated to the public domain.

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the 
public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the
companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their 
contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed 
affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone
is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the
original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary,
for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation 
in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle 
and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build
process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might
fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts
ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the
licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing
your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch.
No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet.
Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of
those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code
base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

Even though SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license,
some users want to obtain a license anyway. Some reasons for obtaining a
license include:

   * You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the
     public domain.
   * You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the
     right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
   * You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have
     the legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
   * Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a license.

If you feel like you really have to purchase a license for SQLite, Hwaci,
the company that employs the architect and principal developers of SQLite,
will sell you one.
